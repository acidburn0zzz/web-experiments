<div class="row wide">
	<h1>Dialog Windows</h1>
	<h2>Message Dialog</h2>
	<p>Message dialogs are the simplest type of dialog. They present a message or question, along with 1-3 buttons with which to respond. They are always modal, meaning that they prevent access to their parent window. Message dialogs are an appropriate choice when it is essential that the user sees and responds to a message.</p>
	<p>For example here is the message dialog about disabling Location Services</p>
	<!-- <div class="gtkdialog" id="locationServicesDialog"> -->
		<div class="gtkdialog-window message-dialog">
			<div class="gtkdialog-content">
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Disable Location Services?</h3>
					<p>Disabling location services will prevent applications from knowing your location. This may cause some applications to not function properly.</p>
				</div>
				<a class="button text-button float-left">Cancel</a>
				<a class="button text-button float-right">Disable</a>
			</div>
		</div>
	<!-- </div> -->
	<h2>Action Dialog</h2>
	<p>Action dialogs present options and information about a specific action before it is carried out. They have a heading (which typically describes the action) and two primary buttons — one which allows the action to be carried out and one which cancels it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, the user may be required to choose options before an action can be carried out. In these cases, the affirmative dialog button should be insensitive until the required options have been selected.</p>
	<p>For example here is an Action dialog for changing the device name.</p>
	<!-- <div class="gtkdialog"> -->
		<div class="gtkdialog-window action-dialog">
			<div class="titlebar" title="Device Name">
				<a class="button text-button float-left">Cancel</a>
				<a class="button text-button suggested-action float-right">Apply</a>
			</div>
			<div class="gtkdialog-content">
				<p>Choose a new device name. This is how it will appear to others and over the network.</p>
				<ul class="listrow unstyled">
					<li>
						<input class="entry full-width" placeholder="Computer"></input>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h2>Presentation Dialog</h2>
	<p>Presentation dialogs present information or controls. Like action dialogs, they have a header bar and a subject. However, instead of prefixing an action, their content relates to an application or content item.</p>
	<p>About or Properties dialogs are good examples of how dialogs can be used to disclose additional information which is not always needed in the main application window.</p>
	<!-- <div class="gtkdialog"> -->
		<div class="gtkdialog-window">
			<div class="titlebar grouped">
				<div class="button-group float-left"><a href="" class="hidden"></a></div>
				<div class="title-group"><span class="title">About</span></div>
				<div class="button-group float-right">
					{%- include components/close-button.html close = "gtkdialog" -%}
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="gtkdialog-content">
			</div>
		</div>
	<!-- </div> -->
